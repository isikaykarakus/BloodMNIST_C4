# BloodMNIST Classification Project

This repository contains the final project for the *Machine Learning for Human Data* course at the University of Padova, focused on developing and evaluating custom deep learning models for blood cell image classification using the BloodMNIST dataset.

## Models

| Model Variant         | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline CNN**      | A standard convolutional network with 3â€“4 Conv2D layers, BatchNorm, MaxPooling, and Dropout layers. Serves as a foundational model. |
| **Custom Encoder CNN**| A deeper model inspired by the encoder path of U-Net, adapted for image classification with global average pooling and dense output layers. |
| **Enhanced CNN (SE)** | The custom encoder model augmented with **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks** to capture channel-wise attention and improve feature discrimination. |

## Evaluation

- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- Training vs. validation loss/accuracy curves
- Training time, model complexity (#params)

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run

You can open and run the notebook directly in **Google Colab**:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/isikaykarakus/BloodMNIST_C4/blob/main/notebooks/bloodmnist_main.ipynb)

Or clone the repo locally and run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isikaykarakus/BloodMNIST_C4.git
cd BloodMNIST_C4
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
